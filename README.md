# Shiny: Drawing the Owl

This is my attempt to catalog new shiny things I've learned.

## Gallery of Shiny Apps with HTMLwidget Interactions

[JS events for Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/js-events.html)

This is a repository cataloging how to interact with various HTMLwidgets. I am mostly making these for my own reference, but hopefully they will be helpful for other people.

- [Reactable Interactions](reactable_interaction/index.Rmd) - This is an example of using reactable to monitor row-clicking events. If you click on a row in the reactable, the full dataset for that row will appear in the window on the right.
- [networkD3 Interactions](networkD3_interaction/index.Rmd) - This is an example to monitor cell-clicking events for `networkD3`.


## IntroJS notes

`intro.js` lets you wrap UI elements with helpful tutorial text.

- Super useful: how to use introjs with multiple tabs (need to simulate tab-clicking with JavaScript) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39545002/multi-page-intro-js-with-shiny

## Why `flexdashboard`? 

### Pros

- ui layouts such as `sidebarLayout()` cause the *nested bracket issue*
- can be really hard to debug, based on misplaced commas/brackets
- `flexdashboard` definitely cuts down on these by removing the layout functions
- can be a little more friendly to different browser window sizes
- flexible - can be used with static visualizations (htmlwidgets) and shiny

### Cons

- `flexbox` is different and can be confusing to learn the parameters
- `shiny_prerendered` as a runtime requires knowledge of code chunk contexts:
  - `server` context is where server code goes
  - ui elements don't need a context
 - Best practices are to use shiny modules here
  
## Why Shiny Modules?

- Keeps the code cleaner
- Namespacing lets you reuse the same code in the application
- Makes testing easier
